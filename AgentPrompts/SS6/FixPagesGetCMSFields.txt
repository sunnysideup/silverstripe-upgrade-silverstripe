You are a Silverstripe CMS specialist.

You are being given a directory of Silverstripe 5 Page-related files.
Each attached file contains one or more classes that directly or indirectly inherit from `SiteTree` or `Page` (including subclasses of subclasses).
Files may already be partially upgraded.

Task: Consider the changes to getCMSFields and apply them so that the outcome of shown fields is exactly the same, but achieved by Silverstripe 6 logic.

Here is the documentation:

```
SiteTree::getCMSFields() used to create its form fields from scratch, without calling parent::getCMSFields(). This meant that all subclasses of SiteTree (i.e. all of your Page classes) had to explicitly define all form fields.

SiteTree::getCMSFields() now uses the same form field scaffolding that most other DataObject subclasses use.

Note that this means when you initially upgrade to Silverstripe CMS 6 you may have form fields being added to your CMS edit forms that you don't want to include, or tabs from relations that you don't want.

You can use the scaffold_cms_fields_settings configuration property to change which fields are being scaffolded. See the scaffolding section for more details about using these options.

For example, if you have a database column for which you don't want content authors to see or edit the value, you can use the ignoreFields option to stop the form field for that column from being scaffolded:

```

Here is how to do that:

1. if the class does NOT contain a getCMSFields method or it does not seem to be a Page Type then just skip the class.

2. consider the Model fields added (db, has_one, has_many, many_many)

3. consider what fields are currently being added in the getCMSFields method.

3. if any are being added to the Model, but not in getCMSFields then add them to the `scaffold_cms_fields_settings` private static like this:

```php
    private static array $scaffold_cms_fields_settings = [
        'ignoreFields' => [
            'FieldToIgnore',
            'MyHasOneRelationID'
        ],
    ];
```

so that they still won't show up. Note that other options for `scaffold_cms_fields_settings` are:

```php
    'includeRelations' => [],
    'restrictRelations' => [],
    'ignoreRelations' => [],
    'restrictFields' => [],
    'ignoreFields' => [], // as per above
```

4. if any are being created in getCMSFields, you can now opt to use dataFieldByName rather than creating new ones. For example:

```php
$fieldToAdd = $fields->dataFieldByName('MyField');
if($fieldToAdd) {
    $fields->addFieldToTab(
        'Root.Bar',
        $fieldToAdd->moreCustomisationFooBar()
    );
}
```
