You are being given a directory of Silverstripe 5 Page-related files.
Each attached file contains one or more classes that directly or indirectly inherit from `SiteTree` or `Page` (including subclasses of subclasses).
Files may already be partially upgraded.

Task: Consider the changes to getCMSFields and apply them so that the outcome of shown fields is the same, but achieved by Silverstripe 6 logic.

Here is the documentation: https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/6/changelogs/6.0.0/#sitetree-scaffolding

Here is how to do that:

1. if the class does NOT contain a getCMSFields method or it does not seem to be a Page Type then just skip the class.

2. consider the ORM fields added (db, has_one, has_many, many_many)

3. consider what fields are currently being added in the getCMSFields method.

3. if Any are being added to the ORM, but not in getCMSFields then add them to the `scaffold_cms_fields_settings` private static like this:


```php

    private static array $scaffold_cms_fields_settings = [
        'ignoreFields' => [
            'FieldToIgnore',
        ],
    ];

```

4. if any are being created in getCMSFields, you can now replace that

```php

$fieldToAdd = $fields->dataFieldByName('MyField');
if($fieldToAdd) {
    //.....
}

```




Here is some documentation:
- Silverstripe 6 BuildTask: https://api.silverstripe.org/6/SilverStripe/Dev/BuildTask.html
- Silverstripe 6 PolyCommand: https://api.silverstripe.org/6/SilverStripe/PolyExecution/PolyCommand.html
- Changelog for BuildTasks: https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/6/changelogs/6.0.0/#cli-changes

Note:

1. BuildTask now extends Polycommand.

2. We are providing you files in isolation, so any missing types or methods can be ignored in a diagnostic check.

Action:

1. Replace `run(HTTPRequest $request)` with `protected function execute(InputInterface $input, PolyOutput $output): int`.

2. Remove `DB::alteration_message` checks and `echo`, as well as other outputs such as print_r(); use `$output->writeln()`. Do not output "Done"; return Command::SUCCESS instead.

3. Properties: `$segment → protected static string $commandName`; `$title → protected string $title`; `$description → protected static string $description`.

4. CLI options: Implement `getOptions(): array` for any `$request->getVar()` or similar (e.g. $_GET) checks using `InputOption`. When declaring InputOption, add a shortcut flag (second argument).

5. Namespaces: Remove `Director`, `HTTPRequest`; add `PolyOutput`, `Command`, `InputInterface`, `InputOption`. Update `BuildTask` namespace.

6. Task names: Always use explicit short `$commandName`. Apply known mappings (e.g., `DeleteAllJobsTask → delete-queued-jobs`).

7. Other rules: Remove deprecated APIs; ensure PHP 8.4+ compatibility; keep refactors minimal; mark uncertain replacements with `// @TODO (SS6 upgrade)`.

8. Apply these rules to every BuildTask-derived class encountered across all attached files.

9. Make sure the class still extends BuildTask at the end

Output: For every modified file, provide the upgraded SS6 code (clearly label each file). After all code blocks, include a concise explanation of the important changes, reasons, and follow-up checks (e.g., cron jobs or scripts referencing old names).

Constraints: Do not invent APIs; preserve original logic; use explicit imports; translate request variables into CLI options.
